Telegram bot interface
======================

This is a controller to enable communication with R2 via telegram communication. Internet access is required of course.

Install
-------

1. Create a bot in telegram: https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather
2. Copy config.cfg-default to config.cfg
3. Set bot token in config.cfg
4. Start bot program

Commands
--------

Current commands are:

* status - This will give current droid status (nothing at the moment, but eventually battery level, etc.)
* mute - Shut the damn thing up
* maxvol - Go loud
* sounds - Either on its own will give a list of sounds, or supply an MP3 name to play that sounds from the droid.
